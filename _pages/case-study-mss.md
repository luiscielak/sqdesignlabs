## Intro

**Movers Specialty Service (MSS)** focuses on relocating highly valuable and sensitive items, such as priceless artwork, delicate lab equipment, and historical artifacts.

MSS needed an app to **improve their workflow and customer experience**. More specifically, they wanted a way to **prepare their technicians for jobs** and to **notify customers of estimated times of arrival**.

MSS gets hired by movers and relocators to pack delicate and valuable items. MSS technicians get dispatched to the customer's location. On-site, the technician builds a custom crate for the mover to load into the truck and transport. Upon arrival at destination, an MSS technician is dispatched in order to unpack the crate.

The way it works:
Tech gets dispatched, arrives at location, builds a custom crate for each item, packs it, leaves, movers move, then technician gets dispatched to unpack.

### Design Lead
- In charge of facilitating discovery sessions and workshops
- Create sketches and wireframes
- Build prototypes and conduct usability studies
- Create and implement reusable components
- Conducted user research

![My Role](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192396188-82c67df4-d643-4ca4-ad73-9e573f3eb98c.jpg)

## The Context
Movers Specialty Service (MSS)  was developing a Progressive Web App (PWA) to **enhance the current packing and logistics tool for movers and relocators**.

![The Context](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192396189-86c21ce3-c40e-4378-85e1-d1ba7a2020b2.jpg)

## The Objective

To research and design an end-to-end dispatching experience to help movers, drivers and technicians communicate and focus on safety and accessibility while on the move.

The objective for this project was to build a tool for the technicians and drivers to simplify their workflow, communicate better and be as focused and safe while on the move.

![The Objective](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192396192-ebed02f4-8736-48bb-8665-ac36c30e0fe2.jpg)

## The Problem

Technicians have to balance a set of apps, instructions and check lists, while doing driving, the crate building and packing work.

The current solution did not work offline, which is necessary in remote areas with limited connectivity where the technicians operate. It was hard to use because of confusing flows and cumbersome UI. Ultimately, it was not being adopted my the client's partners, so alternative paper-based work-flows were applied. Thus these processes were prone to error, and jobs took a significant amount of time to process.

üì° No Offline Access
üëΩ Cumbersome UI
üòñ Confusing Flow
ü§ù Poor Partner Adoption

![The Problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192396193-0f79b9ed-4048-467f-aecd-a3ba4e1e462d.jpg)

## Process: Empathize
Let me take you through my design process.

Starting with Empathize.

![Process_ Empathize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/193654328-5f46b73a-2f77-41e1-b136-0b812e7386dc.png)

First we needed to gain clarity on what frustrates our customers the most.

What are their motivations? Their frustrations?

Executives did not have an understanding of the technicians' main struggles. We needed to make sure we were building the right set of features for this MVP.

### Shared understanding of product vision & human-centric goals
- Company executives were not aware of the impact the legacy app had with dispatched technicians in the field
- Prioritize features that deliver business value
- Establish technical approach to create a realistic, achievable MVP


![Empathize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192396194-952c13f7-df4d-4991-9540-07c095076a3b.jpg)


I went on ride-alongs with drivers and techs to get an understanding of how they work, their points of friction.

This informed my design decisions, and allowed to steer the conversations in the right direction with the stakeholders.

### Went on ride-alongs with movers to learn and analyze the process.
- Shadowed and interviewed 10+ people across multiple roles (mover, dispatcher, shipper, customer, driver)
- Conducted a discovery workshop with stakeholders, product and development teams
- This informed user experience decisions, from feature ideation to app flows and screen design

![Empathize (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192396198-5385b236-d802-48a0-a38b-e4916a433772.jpg)


### Discovery Workshop Takeaways
- Field technicians have too many confusing forms to complete
- Navigating the current app to complete job forms is cumbersome
- In-house teams do not have the appropriate tools to support field technicians in remote areas

The main takeaways from the sessions were that the team lacked the proper tools to work efficiently and effectively

The tools were needed to enable to batter care for their customers.

### Ride-Along Takeaways

- Too many steps, too many screens to keep track
- Small on-screen touch areas, cumbersome to use while driving
- Unreliable Internet access in remote areas prevents system access

The main takeaways from the research were around the themes of ease of use, accessibility, and network connectivity.

## Process: Conceptualize

![Process_ Conceptualize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/193654360-96758f91-6145-40b5-8bb9-af7c045f82df.png)

### With a clear understanding of the workflow and experienced pain-points we needed to prioritize feature areas

- Understand key pain-points and safety concerns
- Classify all insights gathered
- Present our synthesis to stakeholders

![Conceptualize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192396204-3bb52e6d-566f-4987-8528-e5158bb85ae8.jpg)




## Conceptualize
As we started to build these flows, we were constantly validating our hypothesis and solutions with our customers.

Prioritizing, validating, and prioritizing was key to our success.

### Jumped into secondary research to form our product strategy and experience.

- Created user workflows and journeys
- Prioritized customer pain-points, wants and needs
- Validated insights with customers

![Conceptualize (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192396208-c71af4eb-2412-4b33-a4d9-a86e4195c85a.jpg)



### User Journey Map

And by mapping out these experiences into flows, we can uncover points of friction and areas of opportunity.

- Retrieving assigned job details is cumbersome
- Dead-zones prevent crucial job information flow
- Customers do not receive clear job status estimates


![Customer journey map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192396210-2d0ba596-58b1-486a-b768-032e8a6f34e6.jpg)


### Current State
The current solution was not optimized for technicians on the move.

Not only was it hard to interact with the UI, the flows and procedures did not make sense.

Designed to support a paper-based system and process.

![Current State](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192396207-ec246f3b-85d9-4963-bd0d-cdcda7d9762c.jpg)


### Key Takeaways

Drivers are constantly relying on a secondary device in order to get better navigation, communicate with the customer, and interact with the dispatcher.

- Drivers rely on a secondary device for navigation, traffic and photos
- Drivers manually notify the customer and dispatcher of their current status and travel estimates
- Paper forms and legacy process overhead is significant
![Key takeaways](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192396211-14c1050e-8740-4d63-a3f7-93f37eea7a01.jpg)


## Process: Design

Let's design some solutions.

### Estimation and user stories:
A collaboration between product owners, designers and engineers

- What features should we prioritize?
- How do we estimate effort and risk?
- When and how do we involve QA?

The collaboration between design, engineering and project management was key in order to prioritize and estimate accurately.

![Design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192396217-9a1b2b3f-2478-41ff-bd92-1e60ae6db449.jpg)

### Wireframes

Once the flows were established, quick wireframing leveraging the current design system was next.

### Prototypes

Building prototypes with the design system allows us to have higher fidelity concepts out faster.
We could then test those prototypes with users live. Without coding at this point.
