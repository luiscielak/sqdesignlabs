### Intro

PMI’s **Disciplined Agile Toolkit App** provides access to over **400+ techniques, templates and best practices for project success across product delivery teams**. 

This Progressive Web Application (PWA) allows **product owners**, **project managers**, **consultants**, **practitioners** and **educators** to apply, save and share proven techniques across the most popular industries and teams to **improve the way teams work**.

This case study explores how PMI attempts to modernize themselves.

PMI is known for the PMP certification. Many modern teams have moved away from those methodologies of project management, such as waterfall, into a swifter more effective ways, such as Agile and Scrum [cite]().

_PMI acquired DA as a response to serve their clients using these Agile methodologies in their projects and teams._

_One of DA's component is the DA toolkit._

_This case study shows how I was able to redesign the current desktop-only toolkit, into a mobile-first redesign, focused on our customers._

_PMI: leader in PM certification.
DA: is the solution and response to Agile, one of the most used mehtodologies in the tech
PWA: web-based, mobile app, with offline capabilities._

### The Team

### The Context
Disciplined Agile (DA) is developing a Progressive Web App (PWA) as a proof of concept for future PWAs across the PMI organization.

![IMG_8595](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192383687-8742115a-1a8b-40a8-89dd-0aab7443628b.jpg)


### The Problem

_What are we trying to solve?_

Disciplined Agile consists on a collection of many tools and frameworks for working teams. Currently, there is no seamless experience that handles an end-to-end flow for learning, referencing, teaching, and sharing best practices and methods.


### The Objective
Research, strategize and design an end-to-end PWA (progress web app) experience to help PMI’s members leverage best practices, with a focus on increasing mobile reach and certification awareness for this MVP.

_What is the objective of the Toolkit, the project and this whole initiative?_

### The Process: Empathize



![Process_ Empathize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/193654328-5f46b73a-2f77-41e1-b136-0b812e7386dc.png)


Let me take you through my design process.

Starting with Empathize.

### Empathize A
**Lacked understanding in customer wants, needs and expectations.**

- Current frustrations and pain points?
- What did they really want?
- What did they really need?

![Empathize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192348524-e7d7e765-01c9-432f-bd58-f52ed69e5eb6.jpg)

![Empathy Map Miro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/193666723-95cb313d-ec08-4bc0-a253-67f21c8de259.png)

First we needed to gain clarity on what frustrates our customers the most.

What are their motivations? Their frustrations?

I used miro here to facilitate these remote workshops.

### Empathize B

**Dived into an intensive 2-week research sprint.**

- 12+ user interviews
- Investigated experienced and naive Agile users, PMI customers, and non-customers
- Conducted a discovery workshop with stakeholders, product and development teams

![DALL·E 2022-08-30 20 04 31 - An oil painting of a grid of people in a computer screen on a conference call  ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192384242-6c9f2191-90b7-4a3e-ac06-6c65d1395d79.png)

_In collaboration with the UX research team, we dove into an intensive research sprint._

_We separated our user base into experienced and naive users. We conducted interviews, workshops and analysis._

### User Interviews Takeaways
User interviews takeaways

- Content is hard to find, navigate and share
- Purchasing materials, certifications, and training is difficult
- Users do not trust the legitimacy of the content

![User interviews takeaways](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349241-4aa05bba-5c00-4763-8a69-a887edd9f08e.jpg)
![Research Insights Dovetail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/193666725-7b814ddd-c731-4a4b-95fe-1083334a6336.png)

The main takeaways from the research were around the themes of trust and ease of use.

`<List takeaways>`

### Participants
![Participants](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349272-9c782f71-07e0-4ff5-8b9d-d1063c269b07.jpg)

Here is some participant data.

### Exploratory Research
![Exploratory Research](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349299-7bf6356c-ff47-44d6-b7c5-2273bad42ef6.jpg)

A heatmap of the results of some of the studies we did around product messaging, and communication.

We were aiming to understand what is it about the structure of the content and the presentation of information is acting as the catalyst for the lack of trust and frustration.

### Additional Feedback
![Additional Feedback](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349329-4bf84808-8d11-4846-b880-99a8fe149c87.jpg)

Additional feedback focused around:
- language
- tone
- messaging

### Discovery Workshop Insights

- User flows are confusing and cumbersome
- Decision makers do not know what they are deciding on
- Coaches are not motivated to preach Agile

![Discovery workshop insights](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349349-d39fed0b-541f-4a2c-8183-699c95d3fc41.jpg)

We also identified that the lack of conversion is contributed by confusing and cumbersome purchasing flows.

For the B2B customers, the decision makers are unclear on what they are signing their teams and organizations for.

And lastly, the product evangelists, the Agile coaches, are not motivated to spread the knowledge of DA.

### Process: Conceptualize
Overwhelmed with insights, we needed to start prioritizing to form a strategy.

- Understand key pain-points, wants and needs
- Classify all insights gathered
- Present our synthesis to stakeholders

![Process_ Conceptualize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/193654360-96758f91-6145-40b5-8bb9-af7c045f82df.png)

Now to Conceptualize.

On this step, we gathered our insights and began shaping our hypothesis into potential concepts.

### Conceptualize A
**Overwhelmed with insights, we needed to start prioritizing to form a strategy.**

- Understand key pain-points, wants and needs
- Classify all insights gathered
- Present our synthesis to stakeholders

![Conceptualize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349388-66660968-a381-4c78-865e-87f63e8883fa.jpg)


![User Personas Chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/193666727-ce0eca9f-4fb6-4e33-ad87-d348903f60bf.png)
![User Personas Profiles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/193667297-6764179e-d2a1-403f-b01a-024e88c9a631.png)

By mapping out our personas, and grouping them in different ways, we start contrasting and comparing qualities and prioritizing feature sets.

### Conceptualize B
**Jumped into secondary research to form our product strategy and experience.**

- Created affinity maps 
- Prioritized customer pain-points, wants and needs 
- Validated insights with customers
- 
![Conceptualize (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349403-4497492b-5b05-4e8c-8e5b-3d68133d200b.jpg)

As we develop these concepts and features, we are constantly validating with our customers.

### Affinity Map

- Give me the tools to solve my problems
- Provide an experience with less friction and more credibility
- Make Agile work in my teams and organization

![Affinity map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349424-37b97a9a-e605-47cb-9839-5627dc06face.jpg)

By conceptually grouping this feedback with Affinity Maps, we uncover actionable solution for various pain-points.

### Customer Journey Map

- Purchasing process is cumbersome
- Unclear how our customers are currently benefiting
- Clients are not motivated to make a purchase

![Customer journey map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349443-c792d696-1457-4e8e-9be6-d50fa53b9802.jpg)

And by mapping out these experiences into flows, we can uncover points of friction and areas of opportunity beyond a single use case, or touchpoint with a customer.

### Current State
![Current State](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349496-63c88560-443e-471e-a512-de591e36d139.jpg)

The current toolkit was originally designed as a companion to a physical book as a reference tool for  diagrams.

The current experience was not intended to be customer facing, and was not intended for mobile use.

Mobile is a requirement that our customers are demanding.

Issues in current state:

- hard to read, navigate, access

### Key Takeaways

- Content is dense and difficult to navigate
- Products and services are poorly integrated
- Lack of trust and credibility is the most significant threat

![Key takeaways](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349507-7d9fbbfc-cc8f-4b2c-9a51-5a6e6c012f2d.jpg)

The clunky interface and frustrating flows are the most critical shortfalls of the current product.

This results in lack of trust, interest and ultimately the lack of conversions.

### Process: Design

![Process_ Design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/193654372-290d5cd5-23ca-4927-a73b-bd1c08b03c5b.png)


Let's design some solutions.

### Design A
**We were on a very tight deadline and developers needed to start building soon.**

- Should we design mobile first?
- Did we need a design system right now?
- What was our visual design language?

![Design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349580-0304e687-0145-454f-8dfd-68f85783721d.jpg)

We had a very aggressive deadline of 6 weeks to fully develop a PWA.

It needed to work offline, on mobile devices, be easy to use and looked modern and engaging.

And developed quickly.

### Design B
**Once we answered the burning questions, we commenced design right away.**

- Built a design system as a priority
- Moved forward with a mobile-first approach
- Focus on home screen and diagram navigation

![Design (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349611-d00a9447-7321-461c-845d-b9dc80221a9f.jpg)

We needed a tight collaboration with the visual design team, development team, Q&A, and visual design.

`<List areas of focus>`

### Design System
- Implement reusable components to eliminate inconsistency 
- Build a dynamic brand that is scalable and adaptable
- Design responsive components with theming capabilities

![Design System](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349640-b9618d80-9d37-4b5c-a267-075ab0336f77.jpg)

We needed a visual system that could scale with content (techniques, options, categories).

And components that could be reused and repurposed.

We wanted to empowers devs and content creators to build their own pages and templates with the design system we built.

### Specific feature/flow highlights

- Make diagram navigation more obvious
- Consider multiple ways to explore and share content
- Consider how to streamline the home screen

![Specific feature_flow highlights](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349662-f9e9d300-1ca2-4e93-baca-16acabb39784.jpg)

As wireframes and prototypes were created and validated with users, design was iterated and improved upon.

This is some of the initial critical feedback we recevied.

### Overall Design Highlights

- Define multiple ways of navigating the content
- Clearly define terminology and expand support features
- Provide a dedicated onboarding experience

![Overall design highlights](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349688-3ffd827c-acca-4b76-94dc-efe27257d276.jpg)

Some of that feedback was added to a backlog and prioritized.

And we focused on `<List hihglights>`

### The Solution
![IMG_8600](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192384535-bf4b99a1-fde5-4aff-9401-e3fe339e4a7e.jpg)

**How might we organize our content to make it more relatable, accessible and shareable?**

- Improve information design and architecture
- Provide a responsive, dynamic and interactive interface
- Adhere to accessibility guidelines, enable offline access to content, and extend sharing capabilities


_The solution was heavily grounded on how to better navigate content that is very dense, lengthily and difficult to parse._

_This included work on: information architecture, information design, and accessibility considerations._

### The Solution B
**The progressive web app is a great way for customers to view Disciplined Agile content in a new way**

- Working on multiple browsers and sharable through a link
- Responsive to multiple devices (phones, tablets, desktops)
- It works without internet connectivity

![The Solution (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349718-58f7322f-1fa4-4c9c-9edc-dbbe3d6184a2.jpg)

What is the solution? and Why a PWA?

`<List benefits>`

### Demo
![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349765-2e787c68-4ecb-46de-a911-a68205073c39.jpg)


Meet the DA Toolkit.

I design with this philosophy of "Shneiderman Mantra"
Forest > Trees > Leafs on demand.

### Outcomes
**We successfully launched 6 months later an MVP that will serve as the backbone for all future mobile projects in PMI.**

- Adopted by PMI Agile coaches and instructors
- Extended to 3 additional key project initiatives
- The app has become the preferred method for learning, referencing, teaching, and sharing best Agile practices and methods

![Outcome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349794-b2cc3aa9-5b61-4305-abbc-5e561727c59d.jpg)


This project was very successful.

- Adopted right away by Agile professionals.
- And the technology and architecture (technical and information), have become the seed for many future PWA projects to come.

### Next Steps

**The progressive web app is a great way for customers to view Displined Agile content in a new way**

- Create an onboarding experience
- Better UI affordances
- Refine typography

![Next Steps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/349454/192349832-4e03b9ee-8358-4de8-8669-6e9b1f0e25bb.jpg)


One of the biggest challenges was that we were receiving a JSON file that contained in-line HTML styles that prevented from displaying the text better.
